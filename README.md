# ✈️ AeroPredict: GenAI-Powered Predictive Maintenance Platform

**AeroPredict** is a production-grade MLOps and Generative AI platform designed to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft turbofan engines. It simulates a modern industrial AI system by integrating deep learning for time-series forecasting with a RAG-powered LLM agent that generates automated, physics-informed maintenance reports.

The system is built on the NASA C-MAPSS dataset and orchestrates the entire lifecycle—from data ingestion to technician reporting—using Apache Airflow, MLflow, and Docker.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔮 Deep Learning Forecasting:** A custom LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network trained on multivariate sensor trajectories to predict RUL with an asymmetric safety-first loss function.

- **🧠 GenAI Diagnostics (RAG):** A local Llama 3.2 agent (via Ollama) indexes technical manuals to explain failure modes (e.g., "HPC Efficiency Loss") based on real-time telemetry.

- **📡 Automated Pipelines:** Apache Airflow DAGs manage the end-to-end workflow: Ingestion → Preprocessing → Training → Evaluation → Deployment.

- **🖥️ Technician Dashboard:** A Streamlit interface connected to a FastAPI backend allows engineers to upload sensor logs and view instant predictions and AI-generated repair advice.

- **📊 Full Observability:** Prometheus and Grafana monitor system health, container metrics, and inference latency in real-time.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture orchestrated by Docker Compose:

| Service | Technology | Role |
|---------|-----------|------|
| **Orchestrator** | Apache Airflow | Manages DAGs and triggers pipeline tasks. |
| **Model Training** | PyTorch + MLflow | Trains the LSTM and tracks experiments/artifacts. |
| **GenAI Engine** | Ollama (Llama 3.2) | Serves the Large Language Model for RAG. |
| **Backend API** | FastAPI | Exposes model inference and RAG logic via REST endpoints. |
| **Frontend UI** | Streamlit | Provides the interactive dashboard for end-users. |
| **Monitoring** | Grafana + Prometheus | Visualizes hardware usage and system health. |

## 🧠 Diagnostic Methodology

AeroPredict combines data-driven RUL modeling with a physics-informed health index and safety-oriented scoring. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

### 1. Asymmetric RUL Scoring

- The system uses an **asymmetric scoring function** where **late predictions** (predicting failure *after* it occurs) incur significantly higher penalties than **early predictions**. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)
- This aligns optimization with **flight safety**, pushing the LSTM to err on the safe side when uncertainty is high. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

### 2. Health Index \(h(t)\)

- A **Health Index** \(h(t)\) is defined as the **minimum of operative margins** across key subsystems:
  - Fan
  - High-Pressure Compressor (HPC)
  - High-Pressure Turbine (HPT)
  - Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)
- Intuitively, the engine health is limited by the **worst-performing margin**, so taking the minimum captures the most critical bottleneck at each time step. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

### 3. Failure Criterion and RAG Trigger

- When \(h(t)\) crosses a configured threshold (e.g., reaches **zero** in normalized units), the system declares that a **failure criterion** is met. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)
- At this point:
  - The last RUL prediction and trajectory context are frozen.
  - The RAG pipeline queries the *Damage Propagation Modeling* manual for matching degradation patterns.
  - Llama 3.2 generates a final **maintenance and root-cause report** (e.g., “efficiency loss in HPC with associated EGT drift”). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

## ⚡ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Environment Preparation

Ensure the following are installed on your host machine:

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.10 (for local development)
- **Ollama** (for hosting Llama 3.2 on the host, reachable from Docker) [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

Create the base project structure:

```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir -p data/raw data/processed logs plugins tests
```

### 2. Dataset Acquisition

After downloading the NASA C-MAPSS files and the manual, move them to `data/raw` so that Airflow and the ML pipeline can access them via the shared volume. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

```bash
# Move raw C-MAPSS text files so the pipeline can access them
mv data/raw/*.txt data/
```

(If starting fresh, follow the directory setup steps in the Data Management section.) [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

### 3. Setup the GenAI “Brain” (Ollama)

The GenAI module requires **Llama 3.2** running from the host, reachable at `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` so containers can connect. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

```bash
# Pull the required model
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama pull llama3.2

# Start the server with public access for Docker containers
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve
```

### 4. Build and Launch the Platform

Use Docker Compose to build the custom images (Airflow, API, UI, monitoring stack) and start everything in detached mode. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

```bash
# Build custom images and start the microservices
docker compose up --build -d
```

Once containers are healthy, access services using the URLs below. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

## 📈 Monitoring & Observability

- **Prometheus** scrapes metrics from the API, Airflow, and system exporters (e.g., Node Exporter). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)
- **Grafana** dashboards track:
  - RUL inference latency and throughput.
  - Airflow task duration and failure rates.
  - Container CPU, memory, and GPU utilization where applicable. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/28838993/73954e86-4b58-4282-b329-9da4280baf18/README.md)

Monitoring helps detect data drift (e.g., abnormal sensor distributions) and infrastructure bottlenecks before they impact production performance.
